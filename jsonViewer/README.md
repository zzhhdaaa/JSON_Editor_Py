## About The Project

`.json` files are heavily dependent in production environment and there are
many benefits of creating a standalone editor instead of editing the text file directly. 
Not everyone is fan of working with a text editor (like artists) and no one
can be confident to avoid syntax error in their edits.
Moreover, a standalone tool supports features like version control,
validation, schema and more.

The goal of this tool initially serves as my [model view programming practice in PyQt](https://github.com/leixingyu/model-view-tutorial),
but then I thought, why not iterate on it and make it user-friendly, portable and minimal? My goal now is to make this
modular and easily embeddable, so to create a standardized way for displaying and editing `.json` file across applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Qt](https://github.com/mottosso/Qt.py): a module that supports different
python qt bindings

   or alternatively, change the code below to whatever qt binding you have on your machine.
   ```python
   from Qt import QtWidgets, QtCore, QtGui
   from Qt import _loadUi
   ```

### Launch

1. Unzip the **json-editor** package and rename is to something like `jsonViewer`

2. You can either run `main.py` directly or:
    ```python
    from jsonViewer import main
    main.show()
    ```

## Features

### Validation, sort and filtering

- Data validation is a built-in feature that comes with the model/view architecture
as type is preserved during `setData()` and `data()` methods. It then gets translated
into qt element: `str` as `QLineEdit`; `int` as `QSpinBox`; `float` as `QDoubleSpinBox`

- `list` and `dict` type data fully utilized the hierarchical support of `QAbstractItemModel`.

- Sorting and Filtering are enabled with the help of `QSortFilterProxyModel`.

### Serialization

Serialization and de-serialization in the `QJsonModel` enables functionalities like copy/paste (left) 
and drag/drop (right).

| Copy and Paste | Drag and Drop |
|-----|----|

### Raw View

The tool also has a built-in text editor with syntax highlighting known as the **raw view**.

As shown, the data between the **tree view** and the **raw view** are interchangeable.

## Roadmap

- [x] Json text view with syntax highlight
- [ ] Json schema support
- [ ] File drop
- [ ] Custom stylesheet
- [ ] Scripting interface for modular support
- [ ] Web deployment (maybe?)
